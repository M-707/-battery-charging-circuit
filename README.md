I am using 12v 3  lithium ion batterys (IN SERIES) to get 12v at the output.
1-lithuim ion battery is live more 10 years at least taking operating place will be in Saudi Arabia with 45 Celsius degrees.
2-Can provide nearly Unlimited current to the load ( future upgrade to motors ).
3- Less dangerous than LiPo4 battrey.
drawbacks/
A little bit more expensive than other types.
Bigger.

As  one 12 dc motor drive 0.33 A resulting two 12 dc motors connecteed  IN PARALLEL with 0.66 A.

with turning on and off load circuit with slide switch.
if green led is on load is on ( motor ).
